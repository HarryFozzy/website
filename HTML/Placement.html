			  <h3 class="title">Week 1 (4.7.22 - 8.7.22)</h3>
			  <p>I had a very action packed first week. I learnt all about DriveWorks the company. I had introductions to every team that we have, from the Develoment Team to the Sales Team. As well as all of the introductions I also had problem solving training and learnt about the approach to work at DriveWorks. I learnt more about a company in one week than I have anything else. </p>

			  <h3 class="title">Week 4 (25.7.22 -29.7.22)</h3>
			  <p>To further my knowledge in DriveWorks this week I started my first DriveWorks Pro project. My manager tasked me with recreating the Scissor Lift demo that is on the DriveWorks website. This was a challenging task as I had only had the basic training but I learnt lots very quickly this way. This week there was also an onboarding activity for all of the new employees which was a great time to solcialise and meet some great people. Ending the week with a project review with my manager who was very impressed with the progress the interns were making.</p>

					In July 2019, I embarked on an enriching journey to the Netherlands, where I had the invaluable opportunity to work at Tata Steel. This week-long work experience allowed me to immerse myself in an engineering environment, gaining firsthand insights into the intricacies of the industry. The warm reception and genuine kindness extended by the Tata Steel team created a supportive atmosphere, enabling me to absorb a wealth of knowledge from seasoned professionals. Despite the relatively short duration, I was fortunate to receive a comprehensive overview of the entire company, providing me with a broad understanding of its operations.

						<br><br>During my time at Tata Steel, I was fortunate to engage in a diverse array of tasks and experiences. Each day brought new challenges and learning opportunities, allowing me to witness the breadth and depth of work undertaken within the organization. This experience served as a pivotal milestone in my personal growth as well. It was one of the first instances in which I ventured away from home, embracing the prospect of staying with unfamiliar individuals in an entirely new setting. This venture not only bolstered my independence but also facilitated lasting connections with the people I resided with. The friendships forged during this period are ones that I cherish, and I eagerly anticipate revisiting them in the future.
						
						<br><br>Insert Jobs here 
						
						<br><br>Reflecting upon my time at Tata Steel, I am immensely grateful for the knowledge gained, the skills honed, and the friendships formed. This transformative experience provided me with a glimpse into the world of engineering and instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of the industry. As I look towards my future endeavors, I am inspired by the warmth and expertise of the Tata Steel team, further fueling my passion to pursue a career in this field.</p>

					In July 2019, I embarked on an enriching journey to the Netherlands, where I had the invaluable opportunity to
					work at Tata Steel. This week-long work experience allowed me to immerse myself in an engineering environment,
					gaining firsthand insights into the intricacies of the industry. The warm reception and genuine kindness
					extended by the Tata Steel team created a supportive atmosphere, enabling me to absorb a wealth of knowledge
					from seasoned professionals. Despite the relatively short duration, I was fortunate to receive a comprehensive
					overview of the entire company, providing me with a broad understanding of its operations.

					<br><br>During my time at Tata Steel, I was fortunate to engage in a diverse array of tasks and experiences.
					Each day brought new challenges and learning opportunities, allowing me to witness the breadth and depth of
					work undertaken within the organization. This experience served as a pivotal milestone in my personal growth
					as well. It was one of the first instances in which I ventured away from home, embracing the prospect of
					staying with unfamiliar individuals in an entirely new setting. This venture not only bolstered my
					independence but also facilitated lasting connections with the people I resided with. The friendships forged
					during this period are ones that I cherish, and I eagerly anticipate revisiting them in the future.

					<br><br>Insert Jobs here

					<br><br>Reflecting upon my time at Tata Steel, I am immensely grateful for the knowledge gained, the skills
					honed, and the friendships formed. This transformative experience provided me with a glimpse into the world of
					engineering and instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of the industry. As I look towards
					my future endeavors, I am inspired by the warmth and expertise of the Tata Steel team, further fueling my
					passion to pursue a career in this field.
